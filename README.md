# BlockChain

For this challenge, we created a block chain that allowed us to create a series of chained blocks, each showing the hash of the previous block.  For my work, I have attached a screen shot desmonstrating the ouput.  In this screenshot, you can see that multiple blocks have been created, and that the validate buttons shows as "True".

Some of the challenges that I faced along the way was the difficulty of accessing the powershell to code streamlit run app.py correctly.  The method that my TA made mention of was to use the PowerShell prompt in the Anaconda Navigator.  Once I understood how to access that, it didn't take long to complete the challenge.  For those who are having a hard time accessing the streamlit directly from VS Code, it would be worth looking into to try the method using PowerShell through the Anaconda Navigator.
